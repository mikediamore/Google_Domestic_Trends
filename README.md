Python implementation of the following paper http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2015/186_report.pdf

Currently a work in progress, but coming along quickly! I've implemented a few first pass models in Keras 
and plan to rewrite them in raw tensorflow for practice, there are also some features not implemented in Keras that I want to try.
Like "attention" for LSTMs.
